/**
 * Implements Draw Dominoes game logic
 *
 * DRAW DOMINOES RULES:
 * - 2-4 players each get 7 dominoes (6 if 2 players)
 * - Player with highest double starts, or highest domino if no doubles
 * - Players take turns placing dominoes that match either end
 * - If can't play, draw from boneyard until you can play (or it's empty)
 * - First player to empty their hand wins the round
 * - If game is blocked, player with lowest pip total wins
 * - Winner scores the total pips in all other players' hands
 * - First to reach target score (usually 100) wins the game
